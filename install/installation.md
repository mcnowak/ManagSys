I was testing web application on:
    PHP 5.4
    MySQL 5.6
    XAMPP 3.2.1

Installation:
1. Import file ManagSys.sql into MySQL
2. To connect with database change the db.php file for your installation. You will need this information:
- Database Name;
- Database Username;
- Database Password;
- Database Server;
3. Open http://localhost/ManagSys/index.php
